			Hello! I am Joselyn Kate, a Los Angeles-based multidisciplinary artist. I am currently attending El Camino College, with future plans to further my education at California State University, Northridge. I plan to earn a bachelor's degree in film production with a minor in fashion design. With film production, I am passionate towards the art form in its entirety. I love the writing, directing, special effects, costumes, and music in films. My approach to film production is that the more knowledge and creative skill sets I hold, the more cohesive and long lasting impact my work will have when finished. My overall artwork is inspired to defy convention, and embrace a unique, occasionally strange mix of dark and light elements. I am also committed to addressing serious, often overlooked societal issues such as feminism, queer and disability rights through my art.

				Be Represented. Feel Seen." is Joselyn Kate's documentary in development that is inspired by their research essay on mental health representation in media. The documentary will artistically visualize Joselyn's analysis of the work of published peer-reviewed research and includes interviews Joselyn conducted of people who have mental illnesses. Media is a powerful tool that could highlight those who are not represented and can lead to those underrepresented groups feeling seen. However, in order for the media to make positive impacts, the media must include accurate depictions of mental illnesses to avoid creating stigma.

				"The Dissociation" "The Obsession and Compulsion" and "The Depression" are written horror short films that show how disabling mental illnesses can be, but shows how having a mental illness is not a death sentence. The Dissociation is about a person struggling with depersonalization and derealization and how they pull themselves back to reality. The Obsession and Compulsion showcases a person experiencing violent intrusive thought obsession and as they learn how they cope. The Depression is about an entity, The Depression, slowly taking over a person’s life.

    <p>When Joselyn first learned how to sew, they started off making clothes for toddlers. Here is Joselyn’s first sewing project that fits an adult and is the first dress they have sewn. It is a Cruella de Vil costume and the pattern is from Simiplicy R10980.</p>

    <p>Joselyn was instructed to pick a traditional garment and turn it into a modern garment in their textiles class. Inspired by their Peruvian culture, Joselyn chose to combine a Peruvian textile and a Quechua wool jacket into a modern corset. The pattern is by Emma Breeze and Joselyn added embellishments to the original design.</p>

    <p>Joselyn was instructed to turn a traditional huipil into a modern huipil in their textiles class. This was a group project, and the group wanted the huipil to incorporate an abstract design. Joselyn’s design was chosen for this project and the group worked collaboratively on the sewing and embroidery for this piece. Joselyn also designed the snake earrings for the outfit, which a group member created with their jewelry making talent.</p>

		  <p>"Go F*** Yourself" is an original song written and produced by Joselyn Kate. Inspired by riot grrrl, this song is dedicated for anyone who has dealt with a misogynistic man. Joselyn gathered bassist Miley (spotify: cuffslug), guitarist Omar Saucedo, and producer Xander (spotify: eclipse.xiv) to create instrumentals.

	      <h3>"Toxic"</h3>
		  <p>"Toxic" is an original song that was created to showcase the struggle of leaving a toxic relationship. People outside a relationship tend to wonder why the victim in the relationship will not leave the partner, but it's not that easy. According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline's website, "Leaving is not easy. On average, it takes a victim seven times to leave before staying away for good," (National Domestic Violence's Hotline Website). "Toxic"'s upbeat country rock style is purposely disguising the cry for help message in the lyrics.</p>
